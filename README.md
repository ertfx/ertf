# Operational Approach

Our operational approach is designed to systematically transform educational reform ideas into actionable guidelines. This process starts with the submission of an Education Reform Proposal (ERP), which is reviewed and refined. The promising proposals advance to the Request for Comment (RFC) stage, where they are opened to broader community feedback. This stage is critical for incorporating diverse insights and achieving a well-rounded perspective. Finally, the most robust and widely supported ideas are formulated into Education Reform Guidelines (ERG), serving as the bedrock for practical implementation in educational settings.

### Education Reform Proposal (ERP)

ERPs are the genesis of the reform process, inviting innovative ideas and suggestions for educational improvement. These proposals are scrutinized for viability, relevance, and potential impact, setting the stage for further development.

### Request for Comment (RFC)

The RFC stage broadens the discussion, inviting public and expert feedback on the proposals. This stage is crucial for stress-testing ideas against diverse viewpoints and practical considerations, ensuring the refinement and maturity of the proposals.

### Education Reform Guideline (ERG)

Finalized ERGs represent the culmination of this rigorous process. They provide structured guidelines for implementing the most promising and thoroughly vetted educational reforms, backed by broad consensus and expert validation.
